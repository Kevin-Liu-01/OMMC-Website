# Online Monmouth Math Competition

The Online Monmouth Math Competition, or OMMC, is a 501c3 accredited nonprofit organization which aims to give talented high school and middle school students an exciting and engaging way to develop their skills in mathematics.

We provide an annual original high-quality math competition, in addition to various educational materials and a community Discord server. Our competition is available to all students who are 18 or younger.

üîó Join 6,000+ other competitors and students on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/htASFYcn?utm_source=Discord%20Widget&utm_medium=Connect)! We highly recommend competitors join our Community Discord for the latest updates on OMMC. 

#OMMC Ecosystem

The OMMC Official website is written in Javascript utilizing React, TypeScript, and Tailwind.css.
The website can be found here: http://www.ommcofficial.org/

The scale of OMMC means that we provide several apps to facilitate competitions and training. Find them below:

üìô OMMC [Atlas](https://ommc-atlas.vercel.app/): OMMC Atlas is a comprehensive database of all OMMC Year 1 questions. Use it to practice and prepare for your next OMMC competition!

üìù OMMC [Test Portal](https://ommc-test-portal.vercel.app/): Official secure test taking portal for OMMC Year 3-4 competitions.

üöß OMMC [Sample Portal](https://ommc-sample-portal.vercel.app/): Demo Test Portal for trying out OMMC problems. Uses OMMC 2023 Sample Problem Set 1. Created using T3.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
